*  Overflows are very common in solidity and must be checked for with control statements such as:

if(a + c > a) {
  a = a + c;
}
An easier alternative is to use OpenZeppelin's SafeMath library that automatically checks for overflows in all the mathematical operators. The resulting code looks like this:

a = a.add(c);
If there is an overflow, the code will revert.
